        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            - üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @alexbaker96

            - üëÄ about me: I am a 27-year-old male, and I am a very outgoing, hardworking, and dedicated person with an insatiable curiosity for technology and its application. Coming from a small village in Wales I have always been drawn to the possibilities that lie beyond the horizon. My specific interests gravitate towards the realms of artificial intelligence and cyber security, where i find the challenges and innovations to be both intellectually stimulating and socially impactful. Moreover, my lifelong passion for space exploration fuels my fascination with the intersection of technology and the cosmos, inspiring a sense of wonder and discovery in my pursuits.
            <br>
            - üå± I‚Äôm currently studying at the University of South Wales on a computer science course. I have just started my first of four years on this course pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. The dynamic curriculum has exposed me to a spectrum of subjects, including artificial intelligence and cyber security. These areas of study resonate deeply with my aspirations to contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of secure, intelligent systems.
            <br>
            <br>
            - üå± In my leisure time, i find joy and relaxation in a diverse range of activities that reflect my multifaceted interests. One of my primary passions is football, both as a player and an avid spectator. Whether i'm on the field, feeling the rush of competition, or in the stands, soaking in the atmosphere of a live match, football serves as a dynamic outlet for my energy and a sourve of camaradrie. Complementing my active lifestyle, i am a frequent gym-goer, appreiating the discipline and focus that fitness and weight training brings to my routine. Beyond the realms of physical activity, i delve into the captivating world of anime, finding solace and inspiration in its imaginative naratives and unique artistry. <br> My fasination with space extends beyond academic pursuits, as i avidly consume documentaries and literature on astronomical phenomena. This interest not only alligns with my academic passion for technology but also fuels a lifelong curiosity about the vastness of the cosmos. <br> In my spare time, i make it a prioeity to engage in a myriaf of activities with my partner and family.

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <!-- Information Systems Assignment -->
        <h3>Information Systems Assignment</h3>
        <p>
            I recently completed an Information Systems assignment,The assignment involved conducting a comprehensive assessment of the information technology structure for a new Airline Company establishing its UK operations at Cardiff Airport. The primary goal was to identify vulnerabilities and propose a robust information security framework. The assessment covered computer security, network security, and information security, with a focus on addressing physical, non-physical, and human-related threats.

        <!-- Small C++ Programs -->
        <h3>Small C++ Programs</h3>
        <p>
            As part of my programming journey, I have created numerous small programs in C++. These programs cover a range of topics, from basic algorithms to data structures, helping me solidify my understanding of the language and problem-solving skills.<br /> 1.Monthly income - The first program we had to create was one to calculate the monthly income of an employee. The program had to display the basic pay, bonus amount, medical allowance and overall total income.<br /> 2. Height in meters - i had to  write a program that will take their height in feet and inches, and convert it to meters.<br /> 3.Annual high temperatures - i had to write a program that calculates and reports what the new average high July temperature would be for each of these cities if the temperatures were to rise by 15 percent.<br /> 4. How much paint -  i had to write a program to determine and report approximately how many tins of paint will be needed to paint one coat on a wooden fence that is 6 feet high and 100 feet long. <br /> 5. World population - The population of the world is 7.7 billion (7700000000) Write a program to display what the population is if it increases by 10%, 15% and 20% <br /> 6. Letter shape - i had to write a program that displayed a specific letter pattern. <br /> 7. Burger Stall - i had to write a program that asks the user to input how many of each burger was sold that day, then display the total sales for that day. Display the value with two decimal places. <br /> 8. Project Hours - i had to write a program that asks the user to input the number of days bob and jenny worked on the project and calculates and displays the total time spent by each in hours and minutes.<br /> 9. Average percentage of marks - i had to write a program that asks the user to enter the percentage of marks they obtained in each terminal examination in a year, and then displays their average percentage for the year, correct to two decimal places.<br /> 10. House budget - i had to write a program that asks the user to enter their monthly costs for each of the following: Rent or mortgage, Internet, Gas, Electricity, Water The program should then display the total monthly cost of those expenses and the total annual cost of these expenses.<br /> 11. Coin Toss - i had to write a program to simulate a coin toss. The program should ask the user to enter either ‚ÄòH‚Äô or ‚ÄòT‚Äô. The program should then simulate tossing the coin by randomly generating either 1, representing heads or 0 representing tails. If the user's input should match the outcome of the toss, the program should display ‚ÄúYou Win‚Äù. Otherwise, it should display ‚ÄúYou Lose‚Äù.<br /> 12. Area of a Triangle - i had to write a program that can work out the area of a triangle from 3 sides.<br />13. Mobile Phone plans - i had to write a program that calculates the customer‚Äôs monthly bill. IT should input customer name, which package the customer has purchased, and how many minutes and data were used. IT should then create a bill that includes the input information and the total amount to pay. It should also display how much money package A customers would save if they purchased package B or C, and how much money package B customers would save if they purchased package C. If there would be no savings, no message should be printed.<br />14. Rainfall - i had to write a program that reads in from a file a starting month name, and ending month name, and then the monthly rainfall for each month during that period. As it does this, it should sum the rainfall amounts and then report the total rainfall and average rainfall for the period. <br /> 15.Distance traveled - i had to write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and how many hours it has travelled. It should then use a loop to display the total distance travelled at the end of each hour of that time period.

        <!-- R Calculator -->
        <h3>R Calculator</h3>
        <p>
            One of my interesting projects involved creating Create an interactive Scientific/Graphing Calculator that allowed the user to perform calculations and generate graphs based on the formula or the equation provided.  i had to share the Shiny app on my GitHub Portfolio page after it was hosted through Shinyapps.io
