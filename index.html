            <br>
            - 👀 about me: I am a 27-year-old male, and I am a very outgoing, hardworking, and dedicated person with an insatiable curiosity for technology and its application. Coming from a small village in Wales I have always been drawn to the possibilities that lie beyond the horizon. My specific interests gravitate towards the realms of artificial intelligence and cyber security, where i find the challenges and innovations to be both intellectually stimulating and socially impactful. Moreover, my lifelong passion for space exploration fuels my fascination with the intersection of technology and the cosmos, inspiring a sense of wonder and discovery in my pursuits.
            <br>
            - 🌱 I’m currently studying at the University of South Wales on a computer science course. I have just started my first of four years on this course pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. The dynamic curriculum has exposed me to a spectrum of subjects, including artificial intelligence and cyber security. These areas of study resonate deeply with my aspirations to contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of secure, intelligent systems.
            <br>
            <br>
            - 🌱 In my leisure time, i find joy and relaxation in a diverse range of activities that reflect my multifaceted interests. One of my primary passions is football, both as a player and an avid spectator. Whether i'm on the field, feeling the rush of competition, or in the stands, soaking in the atmosphere of a live match, football serves as a dynamic outlet for my energy and a sourve of camaradrie. Complementing my active lifestyle, i am a frequent gym-goer, appreiating the discipline and focus that fitness and weight training brings to my routine. Beyond the realms of physical activity, i delve into the captivating world of anime, finding solace and inspiration in its imaginative naratives and unique artistry. <br> My fasination with space extends beyond academic pursuits, as i avidly consume documentaries and literature on astronomical phenomena. This interest not only alligns with my academic passion for technology but also fuels a lifelong curiosity about the vastness of the cosmos. <br> In my spare time, i make it a prioeity to engage in a myriaf of activities with my partner and family.
